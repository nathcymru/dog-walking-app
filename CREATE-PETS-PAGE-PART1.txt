Due to the extreme length of the Pets page (800+ lines with all fields), 
I'm creating it in multiple parts that you'll need to combine.

This is a comprehensive page with ALL fields you specified including:
- Profile photo
- Identity (name, nickname, breed, sex, neutered, DOB, colour)
- Microchip details
- Group walk compatibility (15+ fields)
- Health (allergies, conditions, medications, vaccination, etc.)
- Behaviour & Handling (lead type, pulling, recall, reactivity, bite history, etc.)
- Feeding preferences
- Walk preferences

Creating now...
